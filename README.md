# Overview

The goal of this project is for me to learn ArcGIS (Javascript) by showing the area my company serves and some of the major cities we install.

When you run the index.html it will display the map you can use and overview my companies service area. You can zoom in and out with the plus/minus and you can click on the markers to see which city it is in.

# Development Environment

I mainly used VSCode to write the HTML and Javascript. I used Firefox to view the HTML file.

The main languages I used was JavaScript and HTML. I also used the ArcGIS libraries for the map, markers, ect...
